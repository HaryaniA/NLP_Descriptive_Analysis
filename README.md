# NLP_Descriptive_Analysis
Word Frequency Analysis is a descriptive text analysis method that provides valuable information about the usage and prominence of words in a given textual dataset.

### Objective

This repository encompasses the code implementation for a comprehensive word frequency analysis project focused on Elon Musk's Twitter data from 2010 to 2022. The primary aim is to analyze the frequency and significance of words in his tweets during the years 2017-2021. Each individual year's tweets are treated as a document for analysis.

Project Tasks

1. Compute Normalized Term Frequencies:
Compute term frequencies for each year, normalizing them within the scale of [0, 1].

Exclude stopwords from the analysis.

2. Top 10 Words by Frequency:
Identify and showcase the top 10 words (by highest word frequency) for each year.

3. Histogram of Word Frequencies:
Plot histograms illustrating the distribution of word frequencies for each year.

4. Demonstrate Zipf’s Law:
Demonstrate Zipf’s law by creating log-log plots showcasing the relationship between word frequencies and their rank for each year.

5. TF-IDF Analysis:
Utilize TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to calculate and exhibit the five most "important" words for each year.

### Dependencies

Python

Required libraries: NLTK, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn
